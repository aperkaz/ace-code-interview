# Behavioral Questions
Non technical questions, mostly targeted towards knowing the candidate.

Prepare for them, even if no coding or technical prep is involved. The first impression is build with them, so apply yourself.

## Must
Be ready for:
1. Talking about 1-3 previous projects in depth (operational wise)
2. Focus on yourself, even when talking about group projects (do not be arrogant)
3. Ask some questions (genuine, insightful or passion driven)
4. Short and direct answer and questions
5. When it comes to **tell me about yourself**, chronological order works best (college -> after grad -> work experience -> current position -> hobbies)

## Prep
Dust up your old projects and get ready to pitch yourself. Still be concise and consistent in your communication.
